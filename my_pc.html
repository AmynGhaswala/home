	<h1>So for you guys that were wondering if I have built or own a PC and my answer is yes. About 4 months ago, I collaborated with my friend and we built me my PC. For anyone who didn't find any of the other listed PCs on the list interesting, you can check out my build. Here it is:</h1>

<p>This is the PC that I built and created after quite a bit of research. I wanted a PC that I could use to do my school homework with, play video games with at decent settings and frames, and I wanted a PC that I could render videos with. Overall I have to day that it works really well. I apologise for the video quality, it was recorded in low light with a really bad camera but it looks pretty cool if you see it for yourself. For anyone who wants a better look at the parts, I made a build on <a href="https://ca.pcpartpicker.com/list/rKXVkT"/>PCPartPicker</a>.</p>
